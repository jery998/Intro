<h4>Jason Statham</h4>
<div class="Statham">
<p>(/ˈsteɪθəm/; born 26 July 1967) is an English actor. 
    He is known for portraying characters in various action-thriller 
    films who are typically tough, hardboiled, gritty, or violent.
    Statham began practising Chinese martial arts, kickboxing,
    and karate recreationally in his youth while working at local
    market stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was a member
    of Britain's national diving team and competed for England 
   in the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Shortly after, he was asked 
   to model for French Connection, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi's in
   n various advertising campaigns. His past history working at
market stalls inspired his casting in the Guy Ritchie crime
films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and
Snatch (2000).
